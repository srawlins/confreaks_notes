A Greasemonkey User Script
==========================
v 0.9

Summary
-------
This script adds a column to the right of most Confreaks conference pages (see below for supported conferences). This column allows you to keep track of which talks you have seen, which you wish to mark as "Save" for later, and which you never really want to see (again) (called "Ugh"). The changes are persistent between browser sessions.

How to Use
----------
So this isn't 100% user-friendly. If it irks you, post a comment/issue and I'll likely fix it. But I'm not going to make it real pretty and usable if I'm the only one using it. Anyways, click "Yes" if you have seen the video and "No" if you haven't and "No" isn't already selected. Or click "Yes" again; they are toggles. "Save" is different from "Ugh", so they don't toggle eachother. I might change "Ugh" to something less harsh...
